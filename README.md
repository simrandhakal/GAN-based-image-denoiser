# GAN-Based Image Denoiser

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning model using Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) to remove noise from images. The model was trained on a GPU-accelerated platform and deployed via a web interface. The frontend is built with **Next.js**, while the backend is powered by **Django**. The model is also integrated with **Hugging Face** for public access.

## What is GAN?
Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs) consist of two neural networks— a **Generator** and a **Discriminator**— that compete against each other:

- **Generator**: Generates denoised images from noisy inputs.  
- **Discriminator**: Evaluates how realistic the generated images are compared to actual clean images.  

Through continuous adversarial training, both networks improve, leading to high-quality image restoration.

## Dataset
- **Source**: Downloaded from Kaggle  

### Types of Noise:
- Gaussian Noise  
- Salt & Pepper Noise  
- Speckle Noise  

### Dataset Split:
- **Training**: 70%  
- **Validation**: 20%  
- **Testing**: 10%  

## Preprocessing Steps
- Added three types of noise (**Gaussian, Salt & Pepper, Speckle**) to clean images.  
- Resized images to **256x256** resolution.  
- Split dataset into training, validation, and testing phases.  

## Model Architecture
The model incorporates:
- **Custom Layers**: Residual blocks, spectral normalization, and instance normalization.  
- **Optimizer**: Adam Optimizer for efficient parameter updates.  
- **Loss Function**: Adverserial, Pixel, Feature and Smooth loss combined to give Generator loss function and Relativistic Average Hinge Loss for calculating Discriminator loss function.  
- **Training**: Conducted for **200 epochs** with a batch size of **8**.  
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Peak Signal-to-Noise Ratio (**PSNR**) and Structural Similarity Index (**SSIM**).  

## Training Setup
### Hardware:
- **GPU**: RTX 4090 (24GB VRAM)  
- **CPU**: Intel Core i9 (14th Gen)  
- **Training Time**: ~6.5 hours  

## Results
Below is a sample comparison of noisy vs. denoised images generated by our model:
